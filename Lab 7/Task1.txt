Observation 1:

The output is:
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Base Destructor

So no, the Derived Class Destructor wasn't called because when the delete statement is used it only calls the destructor of base class since the pointer is of type Base* and not Derived*.

Observation 2:

The output is:
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Derived Destructor
Base Destructor

This time the Derived Destructor is called first and then the Base Destructor since we made it a virtual destructor which ensures that the derived destructor is called too as it now overrides the destructors.
