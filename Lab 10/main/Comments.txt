The fastest sorting algorithm is **Shell Sort**, with an average time of 27.7508 ms over 5 runs.

1. **Insertion Sort**
   - Average Time: 6835.17 ms
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases. Best case is O(n) when the array is already sorted.
   - Comment: Insertion Sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.

2. **Selection Sort**
   - Average Time: 13115.3 ms
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) for all cases (best, average, and worst).
   - Comment: Selection Sort is slower than Insertion Sort in practice and is not suitable for large datasets.

3. **Shell Sort**
   - Average Time: 27.7508 ms
   - Time Complexity: Depends on the gap sequence used. Typically, it ranges from O(n log n) to O(n^2). With optimized gap sequences, it performs much better than quadratic algorithms.
   - Comment: Shell Sort is significantly faster than both Insertion Sort and Selection Sort, making it a good choice for medium-sized datasets.

4. **Binary Tree Sort**
   - Average Time: 138.196 ms
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the average and best cases, but O(n^2) in the worst case if the tree becomes unbalanced.
   - Comment: Binary Tree Sort is efficient for balanced data but can degrade in performance with unbalanced input.

**Conclusion:**
Shell Sort is the fastest algorithm in this test, likely due to its efficient handling of partially sorted data and reduced comparisons. 
Binary Tree Sort is also efficient but slower than Shell Sort. 
Both Insertion Sort and Selection Sort are significantly slower due to their quadratic time complexity, making them unsuitable for large datasets.
