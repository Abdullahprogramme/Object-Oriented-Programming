Challenges:
1. I made the both the animal and the pet class abstract so basically I struggled to get to know the the symbols and signs that represented these classes in the class diagram.

How I overcame:
1. I asked my friend and TA to first tell me and then I made the Animal class not abstract and worked on it.
