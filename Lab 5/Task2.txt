Q. Why does the MemoryResource constructor run before the NetworkBuffer constructor?

Ans. It is because in the derived class the base class needs to be constructed first as the derived class will extend from it.
Since the base class is called first it's constructor is called before than the derived class constructor hence the message order.
Same but in reversed order with the destructor as the derived class is finished first and then the base class.
