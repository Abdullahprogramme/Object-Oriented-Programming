Question: Why does modifying the original object affect the shallow copy but not the deep copy?

Answer: A shallow copy only copies the primitive data types but for dynamically alotted memory it simply points the second (new) object to the
previous one so they both are pointing to one single object hence altering one effects the other. This doesn't happen in Deep copy since it makes a new pointer variable pointing to new memory.

Note: I have done both tasks 1 and 2 in the same files which are as stated;
1. DynamicArray.hpp
2. Task1.cpp
3. DynamicArray.cpp
